When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  When using more than one computer to work on a project, or when
  colaberating with someone else on a project, it would be useful
  to have work stored in a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If many people were working on the same project them they might want
	to choose a logical point at which to have the remote repository and 
	any changes made there to be included. Manually choosing where and when
	to sync would enable this level of control and avoid conflicts.
