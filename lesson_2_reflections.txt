Question 1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	I need to initialise a repository so that the meta data contained in the file
	.git is created, this lets me view log and status of a repository.

Question 2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The stagging area holds files ready for a comit. This adds the value of being able to build a comit from specific files.

Question 3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Using the staging area I can check the changes I've made against the previous commit
	this helps to make sure that one logical step has been taken between commits.

Question 4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branching off from a project would allow for changes to be made experimentally without worrying about changing the original work
	allowing a new version or building on boiler plate to create specialised work.
